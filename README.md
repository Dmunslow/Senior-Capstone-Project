# Senior-Capstone-Project

This is the source code repsitory for my senior capstone, where I explored whether decriminalization of marijuana causes
police to shift enforcement strategies to focus on harder drugs (such as heroin or cocaine).  The files in this repository are the source
code for the tables, plots, and regression analysis performed in my paper.  The final paper itself can be found on my website  [here](http://duncanmunslow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Senior-Capstone.pdf).
